## Project Overview: Polling App with QR Code Sharing

You are an expert full-stack developer working on the Polling App codebase. Your primary goal is to build a web application that allows users to register, create polls, and share them via unique links and QR codes for others to vote on.

Adhere strictly to the rules, patterns, and conventions outlined in this document to ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability.

## Core Principles

- Consistency: All code must adhere to the specified folder structure and library usage.
- Next.js App Router: All components, pages, and API routes must be structured according to the Next.js App Router conventions.
- Server-First: Prioritize Server Components for data fetching and Server Actions for data mutations to keep client-side JavaScript minimal.
- Adherence: Do not introduce new libraries or frameworks without explicit instruction.

## Technology Stack

- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Database & Auth: Supabase (sole provider)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- State Management: Primarily Server Components for server state. Use useState or useReducer for local component state in Client Components.
- API Communication: Use Next.js Server Actions for mutations (creating polls, voting). Fetch data in Server Components using the Supabase client.
- Utility Libraries: A library like qrcode.react for generating QR codes.

## Architecture & Code Style

- Directory Structure: Follow the standard Next.js App Router structure.

  - `/app` for routes and pages.
  - `/components/ui` for `shadcn/ui` components.
  - `/components/` for custom, reusable components.
  - `/lib` for Supabase client setup, utility functions, and Server Actions.

- Component Design: Prefer Server Components for fetching and displaying data. Use Client Components ('use client') only when interactivity (hooks, event listeners) is required.
- Naming Conventions: Component files should be PascalCase (CreatePollForm.tsx). Utility and action functions should be camelCase (submitVote.ts).
- Error Handling: Use try/catch blocks within Server Actions and Route Handlers. Use Next.js error.tsx files for handling errors within route segments.
- API Keys & Secrets: Never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables (.env.local) for Supabase URL and keys, accessed via process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and process.env.SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY.

## Code Patterns to Follow

- Forms: Use forms that call a Server Action to handle data submission.
- Data Mutations: Do not create separate API route handlers and use fetch on the client side to submit form data. Use Server Actions instead.
- Data Fetching: Do not fetch data on the client side using useEffect and useState in a page component. Fetch data directly in a Server Component.
- QR Codes: Use the qrcode.react library for QR code generation.

## AI Development Workflow

- Testing & Debugging: Use Cursor's built-in @debug or @test commands to get explanations for errors or to scaffold unit tests.

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing your response, you MUST verify the following:

- Does the code use the Next.js App Router and Server Components for data fetching?
- Are Server Actions used for data mutations (forms)?
- Is the Supabase client used for all database interactions?
- Are shadcn/ui components used for the UI where appropriate?
- Are Supabase keys and other secrets loaded from environment variables and not hardcoded?
